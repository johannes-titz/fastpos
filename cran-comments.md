# Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* updated the Date field

## Test environments
* local Arch GNU/Linux install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel, release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE on win-builder release and devel:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Johannes Titz <johannes.titz@gmail.com>'

  As I understand it this is just a reminder for CRAN maintainers.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies
