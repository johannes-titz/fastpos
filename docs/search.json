Let us reproduce Schönbrodt Perugini’s quite famous oft-cited table critical points stability precision 0.1. reduce number studies 10k use multicore support (works GNU/Linux) runs fairly quickly. results close Schönbrodt Perugini’s table (see https://github.com/nicebread/corEvol). Note warning shown, simulations corridor stability reached. long number low, affect estimates much. want get accurate estimates, increase maximum sample size. want dig deeper, can look functions find_critical_pos builds upon. simulate_pos workhorse package. calls C++ function calculate correlations sequentially pretty quickly (know already, right?). rawish approach create population create_pop pass simulate_pos:  Note warning message appears corridor reached, instead NA value returned. Pay careful attention work function, adjust maximum sample size needed. create_pop creates population matrix using method described (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15011/generate--random-variable---defined-correlation---existing-variables/15040#15040). much simpler way Schönbrodt Perugini’s approach, results seem differ. interested population parameters (e.g. skewness) affect point stability, instead refer population generating functions Schönbrodt Perugini’s work.","code":"library(fastpos) set.seed(19950521) n_cores <- parallel::detectCores() - 1 find_critical_pos(rho = seq(.1, .7, .1), sample_size_max = 1e3,                   n_studies = 10e3, n_cores = n_cores) #> Warning in find_critical_pos(rho = seq(0.1, 0.7, 0.1), sample_size_max = 1000, : 33 simulation[s] did not reach the corridor of #>             stability. #> Increase sample_size_max and rerun the simulation. #>   rho_pop pos.80% pos.90% pos.95% sample_size_min sample_size_max lower_limit #> 1     0.1     254   363.0  477.00              20            1000         0.0 #> 2     0.2     241   341.0  452.05              20            1000         0.1 #> 3     0.3     214   307.1  406.00              20            1000         0.2 #> 4     0.4     180   262.0  347.00              20            1000         0.3 #> 5     0.5     144   209.0  270.00              20            1000         0.4 #> 6     0.6     105   154.0  203.00              20            1000         0.5 #> 7     0.7      65    95.1  126.00              20            1000         0.6 #>   upper_limit n_studies n_not_breached precision_absolute precision_relative #> 1         0.2     10000             11                0.1                 NA #> 2         0.3     10000             13                0.1                 NA #> 3         0.4     10000              7                0.1                 NA #> 4         0.5     10000              2                0.1                 NA #> 5         0.6     10000              0                0.1                 NA #> 6         0.7     10000              0                0.1                 NA #> 7         0.8     10000              0                0.1                 NA pop <- create_pop(0.5, 1e6) pos <- simulate_pos(x_pop = pop[,1],                     y_pop = pop[,2],                     n_studies = 1e4,                     sample_size_min = 20,                     sample_size_max = 1e3,                     replace = T,                     lower_limit = 0.4,                     upper_limit = 0.6,                     progress = FALSE) hist(pos, xlim = c(0, 1e3), xlab = c(\"Point of stability\"),      main = \"Histogram of points of stability for rho = .5+-.1\") quantile(pos, c(.8, .9, .95), na.rm = T) #>   80%   90%   95%  #> 142.0 207.0 274.1"},{"path":"/index.html","id":"parallelization","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Parallelization","title":"Finds the Critical Sequential Point of Stability for a Pearson Correlation","text":"Since version 0.4.0 fastpos supports multiple cores. first attempts implement quite unsuccessful several reasons: (1) Higher-level parallelism R makes difficult show progress C++, important time-demanding calculations happen (2) parallelizing solutions work operating systems (e.g. mcpbapply) (3) overhead can quite large, especially small number simulation runs. thought best solution directly parallelize C++. tried RcppThread, end even slower singlethreading. assume experienced C++ programmer make work parallelizing C++ feels bit like torture. intermediate solution quite simple pragmatic: use futures. divided number studies available cores , started  simulations via futures multisession plan.
